These datasets were selected because they originate from different scientific domains and their wide variety in number of classes, features and samples, 
demonstrating that the success of the approach is not dependent on specific characteristics of the dataset.

The HRT (Heart), SEG (Image Segmentation), VOW (Vowel), YST (Yeast), Movl (Movement-Libra) and WAV (Waveform) were obtained from the UCI dataset repository~\cite{UCI}.
The IM-3 and IM-10 datasets from the U.S. geological survey~(USGS) earth resources observation systems data centre~\cite{EROS}.
